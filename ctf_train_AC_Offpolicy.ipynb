    "## Notes\n",
    "- This notebook includes:\n",
    "    - Building the structure of policy driven network.\n",
    "    - Training with/without render\n",
    "    - Saver that save model and weights to ./model directory\n",
    "    - Writer that will record some necessary datas to ./logs\n",
    "- This notebook does not include running the CtF game with the RL policy. Using the network will be separately scripted in policy/policy_RL1.py.\n",
    "    - cap_test.py is changed appropriately.\n",
